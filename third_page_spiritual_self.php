          <strong class="fw-bold">3. "How does the spiritual self contribute to the overall understanding of the self?"</strong>
          <p>
            By giving one a sense of purpose and a connection to something bigger than
themselves, spirituality can aid in the understanding of the self. Additionally, it can provide
a framework for comprehending one's feelings and experiences as well as a sense of
inner peace and comprehension. A deeper understanding of oneself can result from self-
reflection and introspection, which are encouraged by many spiritual traditions. However,
it's crucial to remember that spirituality is a very private and unique experience, so what
works for one person may not work for another.
          </p>
           Spiritual self has a great contribution by understanding ourselves in a way that
people know how to identify their different perspectives about higher being. Different
perspectives, different level of faith has an outcome for us. We learn how to value things
by believing that there is a higher being than ourselves and by that spiritual self helps
every person to understand and deepen their knowledge on how they can view their
spiritual self. In addition to that, spiritual self has widely contributed to ourselves by
communication on the higher being, we all know that having different beliefs can be an
outcome to misunderstanding. Spiritual self is more likely to develop our inner spirit that
connects within the supernatural beliefs that we have. Therefore, spiritual self contributed
in our overall understanding ourselves because it reconnects on how we view ourselves
in those particular beliefs and/or having different religions. Understanding oneself and
knowing our purpose in life is the most substantial thing that we contribute to ourselves,
because by answering those question, by knowing our purpose in life we can definitely
understand ourselves.
