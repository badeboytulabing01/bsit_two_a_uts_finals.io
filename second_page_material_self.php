           As a college student, The challenges that I experience is buying a lot of things that doesn’t need and, I
began to spend money in online market such as shoppee and Lazada. I noticed a significant incline in my
daily social media usage, and I was affected by the socially praised ideals imposed through the media. As
a result, I have no money to buy things that I needed in school. I'm happy that I can buy what I want .
However I realize how to spend money in the right way and because of that I changed and stopped
buying unnecessary things.

          To know our material self means that we know about our body—for example, its size, shape, and
appearance. To know our intrapersonal self means that we know our emotions, preference, needs,
values, opinions, and other internal processes. And to know our interpersonal self means that we know
how others see us. All of these are parts of who we are. The material things we buy are all related to our
desires, our lifestyle, our selves. Be it expensive things or down to the littlest products, products we use
on our everyday lives, it would all explain a lot about our self. Analyzing these would lead you to a better
understanding of your very own self.

          Our clothes, homes, spouses, friends, and other possessions that we refer to as "mine" must be taken
care of if we are to manage our material selves. because it tends to boost our self-esteem and
personality. However, the term "material self" can also refer to material goods that are evidence of one's
efforts and achievements. Therefore, the more material goods you possess, the more respect, approval,
and acceptance you'll receive from other people. For instance, we must value and care for our material
selves.

          To my fellow college students, I would advise them to value their family and friends because they are an
important part of who you are. They are special to you, which makes you bond with them. Likewise, be
mindful of your tangible possessions, such as your clothing, hats, and other items. As a result, your selfesteem will increase. If you're dressed well, you'll feel more confident. Furthermore, in order to succeed
and acquire the material possessions you deserve, you must work and study harder since you are a
student.
