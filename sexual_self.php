        <h1>SEXUAL SELF</h1>
        <p class="lead">
         The sexual-self concept refers to how a person thinks about themself as a sexual individual. It
      speaks of your sexual health, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression and values around your
      sexuality.

                 Sex assignment typically happens at birth based on anatomical and physiological markers. Male and
      female genitalia, both internal and external, are different, and male and female bodies have distinct
      hormonal and chromosomal makeups. Doctors use these factors to assign natal sex. At birth, femaleassigned people have higher levels of <u>estrogen</u> and <u>progesterone,</u> and while assigned males have
      higher levels of <u>testosterone.</u> Assigned females <u>typically</u> have two copies of the X chromosome, and
      assigned males have one X and one Y chromosome.

          <p> 
          <strong class="fs-bold fs-4 text-primary">"GENDER"</strong> <br>Gender, on the other hand, involves how a person identifies. Unlike natal sex, gender is not made up
of binary forms. Instead, gender is a broad spectrum. A person may identify at any point within this
spectrum or outside of it entirely. It is generally considered to be a socially constructed concept

          <blockquote class="text-primary fs-4">
           GENDER IDENTITY
          </blockquote>
          <p>
        One's innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither – how individuals
perceive themselves and what they call themselves. One's gender identity can be the same or
different from their sex assigned at birth
          </p>
          <p><strong class="text-primary">Agender</strong><br>
            A person who is agender does not identify with any particular gender, or they may have no gender at
all. Other terms for this may include:
       <li>neutral gender</li>
        <li>null-gender</li>
        <li>genderless</li>
        <li>neutrois</li>

       </p>

       <p><strong class="text-primary">Androgyne</strong><br>
           A person who identifies as androgyne has a gender that is either both masculine and feminine or
        between masculine and feminine.
       </p>

        <p><strong class="text-primary">Bigender</strong><br>
         A person who identifies as bigender has two genders. People who are bigender often display

       </p> 

       <p><strong class="text-primary">Butch</strong><br>
        A cisgender person identifies with the sex that they were assigned at birth.

a doctor assigned them at birth.

       </p> 

        <p><strong class="text-primary">Gender expansive</strong><br>
     The <u>LGBTQIA Resource Center</u> define gender expansive as an “umbrella term used for individuals
who broaden their own culture’s commonly held definitions of gender, including expectations for its
expression, identities, roles, and/or other perceived gender norms.” Those who are gender expansive
include people who are transgender and people whose gender broadens the surrounding society’s
notion of what gender is.

       </p> 

        <p><strong class="text-primary">Genderfluid</strong><br>
   A person who identifies as genderfluid has a gender identity and presentation that shifts between, or
shifts outside of, society’s expectations of gender.


       </p> 

       <p><strong class="text-primary">Gender outlaw</strong><br>
 A person who identifies as a gender outlaw refuses to allow society’s definition of “male” or “female”
to define them.


       </p> 

        <p><strong class="text-primary">Genderqueer</strong><br>
 A person who identifies as genderqueer has a gender identity or expression that is not the same as
society’s expectations for their assigned sex or assumed gender. Genderqueer can also refer to a
person who identifies outside of how society defines gender or someone who identifies with a
combination of genders.
