   lack of understanding when addressing sex or gender. This is an issue that every college student has
with their sexual identities. Because so many of us are ignorant of these issues or simply choose not
to talk about them, that is why many people suffer from diseases like STDs. It is preferable to start
teaching these concepts right away so that every student, not just those in college but also other
young people, has sufficient awareness of the significance of learning about sexuality, sex, or
gender. Every student can conduct in-depth research on the use of protection or other forms of
contraception to avoid early pregnancy with an open mind.
