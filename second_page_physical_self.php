          <blockquote>FACTORS THAT AFFECT PERCEPTION OF THE PHYSICAL SELF
</blockquote>
          <p>
             <strong>1. Personal Factors</strong><br>
           <strong>a. Introspection and Self-reflection -</strong>  One of the simplest ways to become self-aware is to
look within. Self-examination is the after acting in a given way, a person watches and
analyzes their interior state (mental and emotional). Studies, however, demonstrate
that introspection is constrained by people's propensity to harbor undesirable
thoughts and experiences outside of consciousness and memory.
          </p>

          <p>

           <strong>b. Self-Perception Theory -</strong>  Explains that because it is challenging to comprehend one's
interior condition, people can deduce their inner states through monitoring their own
actions as though they were an outsider. All facets of one's perspective of the physical
world are included. the way he views his physical being.

          </p>
          <p>

beliefs one holds about oneself themselves. It is a compilation of all personal
encounters involving one's traits, social roles, values, objectives, and aspirations.

beliefs.

          </p>

          <strong>
  2. Social Factors
          </strong><br>
          <p>
    <strong>a. Attachment Process and Social Appraisal-</strong> Bowlby says that individuals discover their
worth and lovability when they: learn about the way their mothers or other caretakers
look after them and cater to their needs. These very first encounters are crucial for figuring
out who they are.
          </p>
         <p>
    <strong>b. Maintaining, Regulating and Expanding the Self in Interpersonal Relationship -</strong> The
constant shaping of the concept of self constant communication with others or with
important partners. They serve as "private audiences" for people to share an internal
conversation. But frequently, people aren't even aware that these hidden audiences are
influencing them.
          </p>    
        <p>
         <strong>C. The Looking-glass Self Theory -</strong> According to Charles Horton Cooley, a person's sense of self
develops through their interactions with others in society. and other people's
perspectives. The way one sees themselves is a culmination of their own characteristics
and perceptions of how others see them. Perceive the person.
          </p> 

        <p>
         <strong>d. Social Comparison -</strong> - Leon Festinger offered a different method of comprehending the self
in 1954 by contrasting one's characteristics, skills, or the opinions of others. Comparing
oneself to others in a social setting allows one to assess their own skills and opinions. The
two are as follows:<br>
          <strong>i. Upward social comparison - </strong>  When someone compares themselves to
those who are superior to them, something bad ensues. He might go
through frustration and inferiority<br>

 <strong>ii. </strong>  Downward social comparison happens when an individual compares
himself to someone who is in a worse situation than he is especially
when he is feeling so low. Supperiority and ignorance.

          </p>    
     
      <blockquote class="fs-4">Never comparing yourself to others is crucial for maintaining a positive self-image.
Instead, goals should be reasonable. Expectations for himself.</blockquote>
      
       <p><strong>a. Social Identity Theory -</strong>  Formulated by Tajfel and Turner in 1979 which provides a
framework about how people achieve understanding about themselves by being a
member of their group. People have a need for a positive social identity that is why they</p>

      <p>connect to a wider social network. This idea assumes that as a member of the group they
will not be discriminated by an out-group

     <p><strong>The self belongs to an individual level of analysis which
includes self-esteem, self-efficacy and the like. Identity is
based on societal or cultural level analysis such as cultural
concept of oneself and cultural make up which makes a
person who he is. </strong></p>

     <blockquote class="fs-4">THE IMPACT OF CULTURE ON BODY IMAGE AND SELF-ESTEEM: THE IMPORTANCE OF BEAUTY</blockquote>
         <p>Culture is defined as a social system that is characterized by the shared meanings that are
attributed to people and events by its members.</p>
       
       <p><strong>-</strong> A significant aspect of culture that strongly influences adolescents who are in a face-toface encounter with their physical selves is how their culture conceptualizes beauty.</p>
       <p><strong>-</strong> Young adolescents are forced to adhere to society’s definition of beauty lest they be
labelled ugly. In this age of plastic surgery or ‘retoke’, water-proof and oil-proof make-up,
hair color and highlights, colored contact lenses and Photoshop, NOBODY is ugly.</p>

<p><strong>-</strong> Beauty is defined as the quality of being physically attractive or the qualities in a person or
a thing that give pleasure to the senses or the mind.</p>


<p><strong>-</strong> It should be noted that in every culture and in every individual, the standards of beauty
may vary a lot. Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder.</p>

<p><strong>-</strong>The truth is that for a young adolescent who is uncomfortably going through
physical changes, who lacks knowledge and is uninformed of the difficulties in
the world, BEAUTY is what social The media shapes what fashion models
should appear like, how a fan's favorite star should dress, and behaves.
</p>

<p><strong>-</strong>The body image created by the adolescent which includes perception and feelings about
oneself could either be positive or negative
</p>

<p><strong>-</strong>This is based on how the adolescent measures up to the cultural standards of an ideal
body image.
