        <h1>SPIRITUAL SELF</h1>
        <p class="lead">
        Your Spiritual Self is you in your most beautiful and powerful form. It is the authentic self, the unconditioned part, the you without patterns. This is personal for each of us, so no need to get caught up on the language.

        <strong class="fw-bold">1. "What are the factors or aspects that describe the spiritual self?"</strong>
        </p>

        <div class="article-body flow">
          <p>
            There are a number of various aspects or factors that are frequently taken into
          account while discussing the spiritual self. However, it's crucial to remember
          that spirituality is a profoundly subjective experience, and depending on their
          following elements are frequently linked to one's spiritual self:
          </p>

          <p>
           <strong>a.</strong> The idea of transcendence is the conviction that there is something
               greater than the physical world, such as divine consciousness or an
               infinite power.
               <br>
                <strong>b.</strong> The spiritual self continually searches for meaning and purpose in
               life, pondering issues like the nature of existence, the desire for self-
              improvement, and the pursuit of happiness.
              <br>
               <strong>c.</strong> Numerous spiritual traditions place a strong emphasis on the unity
             of the universe and all living things. The spiritual self strives to
             develop a sense of kinship with other people, the natural world, and
             the divine.
             <br>
             <strong>d.</strong> Spiritual people frequently engage in activities that encourage self-
            reflection, meditation, mindfulness, or contemplation in order to
            obtain a better awareness of their inner world and themselves.
            <br>
            <strong>e.</strong> The exploration and development of one's own moral principles,
            virtues, and values that direct behavior and interpersonal
            interactions might be considered to be a part of spirituality.
            <br>
            <strong>f.</strong> The significance of love, compassion, and kindness toward oneself
            and others is emphasized in many spiritual traditions. The spiritual
            self strives to develop these characteristics in order to advance
            harmony and wellbeing.
            <br>
            <strong>g.</strong> People who are spiritually inclined tend to be inspired by a sense of
            interconnectedness and a desire to help others to perform acts of
            service, be charitable, and have a positive influence on the world.
            <br>

             <strong>2.
            What are the challenges, issues, or problems that college students experience
            about their spiritual self? </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Students in college have to adjust to a new physical, social, and academic
environment. According to a growing body of research, students' social identities
(Tajfel and Turner, 1979) and the psychological factors connected to those identities
can influence how they feel about themselves and where they belong both during
and after their time in college (Walton and Cohen, 2007, 2011; Strayhorn, 2012; Brady
et al., 2020). Racial or ethnic background, gender, or being a first-generation college
student have been the main topics of research on how social identities affect students'
outcomes in college (Walton and Cohen, 2011; Stephens et al., 2012; Walton et al.,
2015; Yeager et al., 2016. Further research is necessary into various facets of students'
identities. Here, we put a special emphasis on students' sense of their spiritual
identity, particularly how much they feel near to God and how much they struggle
spiritually. We investigate the relationships between these spiritual variables and two
other crucial early college outcomes: wellbeing and belonging.
</p>
<p>
  We use the description offered by Exline et al. (2014), who characterize
spiritual challenges as unfavorable thoughts or conflict related to a particular
component of spirituality (such as beliefs, practices, or experiences). Spiritual conflicts
can occur internally or with other individuals or institutions over morality, doubt, or
the ultimate purpose of existence. They can also occur with supernatural beings (gods
or devils), other people or institutions over religious or spiritual issues.
</p>
<p>
  College students frequently have spiritual problems when they reevaluate
their religious and spiritual convictions outside of their family and community
environments (Barry and Abo-Zena, 2014). For instance, students may struggle to
reconcile their religious beliefs with the new information they have learned in their
academic classes. On campus, there may be conflicts between students from various
religious backgrounds. Or, if their spiritual challenges cause them to disagree with
other believers or if the context of the religious community discourages conversation
about existential questions, ultimate meaning, and doubt (Bryant and Astin, 2008),
students may find themselves at odds with other believers within their religion
tradition.

  College students often face various challenges and experiences related to
their spiritual selves. Here are some common issues, problems, challenges that
college students may encounter:
</p>
          <blockquote>
           GROWING UP
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           as children advance in age, their interest change and with these come changes in their bodies.
          </p>
           <p>
           The changes are rapid and before parents notice it, they no longer have babies but unpredictable teenagers. 
          </p>
          <p>
           It is at this stage that parents should respect their teenagersâ€™ privacy and allow them enough space to grow but at the same time let them know that their parents are always there ready to LISTEN and to provide SUPPORT
