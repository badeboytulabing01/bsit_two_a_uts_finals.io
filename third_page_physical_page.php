          <blockquote>THE FILIPINO CONCEPT OF BEAUTY</blockquote>
          <p>
           <strong>-</strong>  Filipinos have a mixed heritage that can be traced back to Malay, Korean, Chinese, and
Spaniard origins, but the original inhabitants of the Philippines, called ‘Aetas’, were dark
skinned and had tight, curly hair and flat noses. The Spaniards referred to these people as
Negritos because they resembled small native Africans.
          </p>

             <p>
           <strong>-</strong>  Euro centrism is defined as “a tendency to interpret the world in terms of European or
Anglo-American values and experiences”. Filipinos with Eurocentric features are seen
everywhere in media. With their fair skin and tall noses, they grace the spotlight and
sweep Filipinos with flat noses and dark complexions under the rug.
          </p> 

           <p>
           <strong>-</strong>  Dark-skinned Filipinos tend to have a negative body image. They feel ashamed and
embarrassed of their bodies because they think they are valued less compared to those
with lighter skin. This proves the importance of visibility and representation in mass
media.
          </p> 

          <p>
           <strong>-</strong>  The message that the society gives is that flat noses and dark complexions do not define
beauty. This foreign standard strongly impacts the Filipino youth resulting in a fixed mindset that what they physically are will not be enough until they meet the Western
standards of physical attractiveness. They will be seen as lacking in beauty simply because
of the structure of noses and the color of their skin. 
          </p>

   <blockquote>SELF-ESTEEM AND THE IDEAL BODY IMAGE</blockquote>
  <p>
           <strong>-</strong>  Self-esteem is defined as the overall evaluation that a person has of himself which can be
positive or negative, high or low.
          </p>

            <p>
           <strong>-</strong> Self-esteem is defined as the overall evaluation that a person has of himself which can be
positive or negative, high or low.
          </p>

         <p>
           <strong>-</strong> There are several factors that may affect a person’s self-esteem and physical appearance is
one of them. It was discussed that as children advance to the stage of adolescence, they
form a body image. Adolescent’s body image includes the following
          </p>
          

  
         <p>
           <strong>1.</strong> Perception of their physical self when they look in the mirror.<br>
           <strong>2.</strong> Feelings of like and dislike about the physical self that they see<br>
           <strong>3.</strong> Their thoughts and how they relate to their physical self<br>
           <strong>4.</strong> Perception of how other people view them physically


          </p>

          <p>A person with a positive body image will have a high self-esteem
and will often spend more time taking care of their appearance.
Also, the attention that he gets for his physical beauty elevates the
level of his self-esteem. On the other hand, when the person is not
satisfied with what he sees which affects how he perceives himself
and feels that he does not measure up to how his culture defines
beauty then he will have a negative body image and a low selfesteem. Unfortunately, some adolescents resort to extreme
negative behaviors in order to meet the so-called status quo.
</p>
     
     <p><strong>The following are some aspects in culture that may have led to the aforementioned
misconception:</strong></p>

     <p>
           <strong>1.</strong> Society’s ideals of the perfect physical form which are: for women: white perfect skin,
small waistline, big breast and behind, long straight hair, long manicured nails, slender and
tall; and for men: tall, tanned perfect skin, muscled physique, with 6-pack abs<br>
           <strong>2.</strong> Images of perfection adolescents see in all types of media i.e. print, television, film and
internet. Mass media is a powerful tool that reinforces cultural beliefs and values. Though
young people may initially disagree with the set ideals of beauty, repeated exposure via
media lead them to believe in the misconceptions.<br>
           <strong>3.</strong> Since a standard has been set by society and reinforced by media, any characteristic that
does not conform to the standard is labelled as ugly. Body diversity in size and structure
due to genetic heritability is not tolerated. Being pretty and white skinned or tanned and muscular had become associated with the intelligent, successful, popular, healthy, and the
disciplined. Opposite characteristics are associated with the dull, lazy, ugly, and the weak
<br>
           <strong>- </strong> These misconceptions strongly affect how the young form their body image and its
influence on their self-esteem. Knowing that adolescence is the period where self-identity
is formed, it is important for adults in the environment to listen to this young people and
provide proper guidance and support.<br>

  <strong>- </strong> Yes, beauty is important, but being beautiful still depends on how a person defines beauty
and the standards he sets to meet his definition.<br>
