         The digital self is the persona you use when you're online. Some people maintain one or more online identifies that are distinct from their “real world” selves; others have a single online self that's more or less the same as the one they inhabit in the real world.

         In virtual environments like online games, virtual worlds, or virtual reality platforms, users often create avatars to represent themselves. Avatars can be customized in appearance, behavior, and interactions, allowing individuals to project different aspects of their identity or experiment with alternative identities.

          <p>
           It is at this stage that parents should respect their teenagers’ privacy and allow them enough space to grow but at the same time let them know that their parents are always there ready to LISTEN and to provide SUPPORT
